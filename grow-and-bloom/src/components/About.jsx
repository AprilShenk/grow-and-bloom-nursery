        Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget
        them. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time
        thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. It all happens
        automatically.

        If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than
        a cloud killer. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks
        for the easiest way to do things You're the greatest thing that has ever
        been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. If we're
        going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and
        take care of them. The secret to doing anything is believing that you
        can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can
        do. Anything. As long as you believe. It is a lot of fun.

        This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. If
        you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Everybody's
        different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Put your
        feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.
